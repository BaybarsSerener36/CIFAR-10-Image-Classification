### **Image Classification Report on CIFAR-10 Dataset Using Deep Learning**

#### **1. Confusion Matrix and Metrics**

##### 1.1. Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is a graphical or tabular representation that summarizes the performance of a classification model or machine learning algorithm. It assists in predictive analysis and serves as an effective tool for evaluating the correctness and errors in a machine learning system.

In a binary classification problem, we typically have a 2x2 matrix with the following values:

- **True Positive (TP)**: The predicted value matches the actual value, and the actual value is positive.
- **True Negative (TN)**: The predicted value matches the actual value, and the actual value is negative.
- **False Positive (FP)**: The predicted value is incorrect and classified as positive (Type I Error).
- **False Negative (FN)**: The predicted value is incorrect and classified as negative (Type II Error).

##### 1.2. Accuracy
Accuracy is a measure of how well the model predicts the correct outcomes across the entire test dataset. It is calculated using the following formula:

```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
```

While accuracy is a good baseline metric, it works well on balanced datasets but may not be as effective on imbalanced datasets.

##### 1.3. Recall
Recall, also known as true positive rate, measures how many true positives were predicted out of all positive cases. It is calculated as follows:

```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```

##### 1.4. Precision
Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It indicates how certain you are that a predicted positive result is actually positive. It is calculated using the following formula:

```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
```

##### 1.5. F1-Score
F1-Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. A higher F1-Score indicates better model performance. It is calculated as:

```
F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

##### 1.6. Specificity
Specificity measures the ability of a model to correctly identify negative cases. It is calculated as:

```
Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
```
